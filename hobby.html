<h1> My Hobbies</h1>
<body>
<h2 id=ask>One of my favorite hobbies is playing tennis. I used to play for my high school team but decided not to play in college.  
I also love to hang out with my family and friends. I like to watch tv and movies as well as spend time outdoors and listen to music.This summer I will be a Riflery Counselor at a camp in Colorado</h2>
